        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Maelynn. I'm 26, and live in Lake in the Hills. I've got three younger siblings, a sister and two brothers, two 
            dogs and a bird. I graduated with a degree in General Studies and a minor in English from Western Illinois University and 
            am taking this class with my sister to learn some extra coding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my hobbies include art, writing, and crocheting.
