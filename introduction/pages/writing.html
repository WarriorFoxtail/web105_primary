        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p>
            I love to write, and have been dabbling in creative writing since roundabouts middle school. I've written small pieces here 
            and there over the years, including some original drabbles, as well as pieces of fanfiction. I tend to mostly prefer fantasy 
            or fiction writing because it's more fun for me to explore and imagine.

        <h3>Mended Past</h3>
        <p>
            One of the bigger projects I've been working on is what we call Mended Past. It's a collaborative writing project my friend 
            and I have been working on for about four years now. It's a high fantasy story very much inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, Lord 
            of the Rings, and mythology. It's currently ongoing and available to read on our website.

        <h3>Guardians of Evolucia</h3>
        <p>
            Another writing project I've been working on since high school is Guardians of Evolucia. This project is still in early 
            concept stages and isn't currently published anywhere. This one leans more towards science fiction with some fantastical 
            elements like super human abilities.
