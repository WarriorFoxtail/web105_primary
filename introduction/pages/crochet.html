        <h2>Crocheting</h2>
        <p>
            I've been crocheting on and off for several years now. My old nanny taught me the basic chain stitch when I was young and 
            my friend taught me how to do the "magic circle" as well as how to make some basic granny squares. Mostly though, I really 
            love making amigurumi toys.

            Here's a few I've made in the past.
