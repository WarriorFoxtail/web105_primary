        <h2>Art</h2>
        <h3>Where I Started</h3>
        <p>
            I've been drawing for probably about as long as I could hold a pencil. I used to doodle a lot in school and have taken a few 
            art classes here and there across my school career. Nowadays I mostly focus on digital art.
        </p>

        <h3>My Tools of the Trade</h3>
        <p>
            When I started drawing I used just a simple pencil and paper, and still do on occasion today. Primarily though, I use the 
            Apple-exclusive app Procreate. Some other programs I've dabbled in are:

                    <li>Clip Studio Paint</lil>
                    <li>Photoshop</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            I also use a stylus pen and art glove.
