        <h2>Art</h2>
        <h3>Where to Start</h3>
        <p>
            All you need to start is a device and the desire to draw. As with most art forms, though there are some common practices, 
            there’s no wrong way to create. That’s the beauty of it.
        </p>

        <h3>What Tools Should You Use?</h3>
        <p>
            It’s all up to personal preference. There are many programs, free and paid, to suit anyone’s needs. I use the Apple-exclusive 
            app Procreate, which gives me access to many different brushes, stamps, filters, color palettes, and even some rudimentary 
            animation software. Apple also has Procreate Pocket, which is Procreate formatted for an iPhone, and Procreate Dream, for 
            creating more detailed animations. Some free options that work well are Ibis Paint X and Sketchbook. If you use a laptop or 
            desktop PC there are programs like Clip Studio Paint or Krita.

            I highly recommend investing in a drawing tablet or stylus pen and art glove, but they aren’t necessary. A mouse or your 
            finger can work just as well. A friend of mine uses an iPad for his art but uses his finger instead of a stylus.

        <h3>How to Get Inspired</h3>
        <p>
            Inspiration can come from anything. I usually go online or go out into the world and just look. Pinterest or DeviantArt are 
            great free online sources to find inspiration. Or, if you prefer to draw something natural, going outside with a tablet or 
            phone and taking a walk through the park can be great for getting the creative juices flowing.
        </p>

        <h3>My Art</h3>
        <p>
            Below are some examples of my art. I’m constantly refining and improving my skills, so don’t feel discouraged if your art 
            isn’t where you want it to be yet. We are our own worst critics. Just keep practicing and exploring and you’ll do just fine!
