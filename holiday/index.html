        <h3>Who was St. Valentine?</h3>
        <p>
            That's a bit of a complicated question.
            According to the History Channel's website, the Catholic Church recognizes several different figures bearing the name.
            One attestation, according to history.com, claims that in the third century, the current Roman Emperor Claudius II outlawed 
            marriage for young soldiers, believing single men to make better fighters. St. Valentine was rumored to continue officiating 
            marriages for these soldiers in secret.

            Another legend, described on wikipedia.com, tells that St. Valentine was imprisoned by Emperor Claudius II, and during his 
            confinement, he met and fell in love with the daughter of his jailer. Some accounts claim he also healed her of her blindness.
            This is also supposedly the origin of the "valentine," when, before his execution, St. Valentine wrote to the jailer's daughter
            and signed the letter, "Your Valentine."

        <h3>Valentine's Day and Lupercalia</h3>
        <p>
            The Encyclopedia Britannica decribes Lupercalia, a pagan festival held in mid February, that celebrates fertility and the coming
            of spring. According to Britannica, Pope Gelasius I banned its celebration at the end of the fifth century, and supposedly
            sought to replace it with celebrations of St. Valentine, but its history remains unclear.

            the US, Canada, Britain, and Australia, and also sees festivities held in Argentina, France, Mexico, South Korea, and the
            Philippines, where it's a common date for weddings and wedding anniversaries.

            As time has passed, the holiday has grown to encompass more than just romantic love. Many people of all ages will often exchange 
            valentines with close friends or family. And as time continues, perhaps there may come a day when that love will be shared with
            strangers too.
