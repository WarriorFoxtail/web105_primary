    <p>EPIC: The Musical is a sung through musical adaptation of Homer's epic The Odyssey composed by Jorge Rivera-Herrans.
        It follows the Achaean captain Odysseus as he travels back to his home country of Ithaca after the 10 year Trojan War.
        Through each section, called sagas, it details the many obstacles that lie in his path, from sorceresses, to gods, to monsters.</p>

    <p>Rivera-Herrans, throughout the musical, utilizes clever musical techniques and motifs to help flesh out each of the characters and certain moments from each saga.</p>

    <h3>Athena and Odysseus' shared melody</h3>
    <p>The first saga, called <em>The Troy Saga</em>, details Odysseus in the last days of the Trojan War.
        The last song of this saga, called Warrior of the Mind, recounts how he met the goddess Athena and won her favor.
        In that song, there is a musical motif that shows up in the form of a riff from Odysseus.
        <b>"If there's a problem we'll have the answer. We are the warriors of the mind."</b>
        This line is sung by both Athena and Odysseus, but only Odysseus sings the riff this first time.
        On the second repeat of the line, they sing in unison again, but this time Athen joins in Odysseus' riff, symbolic of the bond they formed in this moment. <br><br>
        In the next saga, called <em>The Cyclops Saga</em>, again the last song of this saga, called My Goodbye, is a confrontation between Odysseus and Athena.
        This time, however, she reprimands Odysseus for how he handled the encounter with the cyclops Polyphemus.
        In the final moments of this song she sings, <b>"This is my good bye,"</b> several times.
        The first time she sings this line, she mirrors the riff Odysseus taught her in Warrior of the Mind, but the last time she sings it,
        she returns to the sustained note she'd had before adopting Odysseus' riff,
        symbolic of their connection being severed.
