    <h1>Maelynn's Favorite Things To Do</h1>
    <p>Creativity is a lot of fun!</p>
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <h3>Fiction</h3>

    <h3>Fantasy, Folklore, Mythology</h3>
    <p>I don't read as much as I used to now, but I'm a big fan of fiction, particularly fantasty. I also enjoy a good sci-fi story. My fiancee has been trying to get me to read a sci-fi novel called Death Worlders. I'm also a big fan of folklore and fairytales a la Brothers' Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen, and mythology.</p>
    <h2>Writing</h2>

    <h3>Prose</h3>
    <p>I love to write. Lately, I've dabbled more in fanfiction than anything, but I do have an original project I've been working on with a friend. It's a passion project we've been working on for a couple of years now. If you're familiar with Dungeons & Dragons, it's very similar in its style. We also drew some inspirations from things like Lord of the Rings, mythology and folklore, and other such mythical and magical realms in our worldbuilding.</p>
    <h2>Art</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital</li>
        <li>Traditional</li>
        <li>Map Making</li>
        <li>2D Animation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I draw mostly digital art now, though I got my start with just a plain old pencil and paper. I also dabbled a little bit in 2D animation, though my skills with that are far from refined. I'd love to try picking it up again some day. I mostly make maps for my D&D campaign on the map making site Inkarnate.</p>

    <p>I'm taking this class in part to help out my sister, as well as learn some coding. I have some experience with HTML and C++ but not Python. I've always found coding to be really interesting, but never really knew where to start with learning it.</p>
